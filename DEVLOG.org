* Requirements
As stated in the README, the curation process has five steps:
1. data aggregation
2. sanitization - removal of mixtures, inorganic compounds, and salts
3. standardization of structures
4. removal of duplicates
5. manual review

Want to make a program that is modular, so that you can load just the structure
standardization piece (for example) and work with that in a Jupyter
notebook. Need to repackage for this.

Also want to bundle a commandline interface that will take in a file or a list
of files are perform all steps end-to-end, outputting the cleaned results and a
list of compounds requiring manual review.

Want to support a good range of file types.

Definitely need to have good test coverage for a project like this.

* Flow of current program

* Dependencies
Libraries used in this project:
- The [[https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html][RDKit]], an open-source toolkit for cheminformatics.
- [[https://molvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][MolVS]], a molecule validation and standardization tool built using RDKit
- [[https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/][Pandas]], for the majority of the dataset manipulation
- [[https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/][Click]], the "command line interface creation kit", for creating the cli tool
- [[https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/][Sphinx]], a tool for creating documentation

Dependencies are handled by [[https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#basic-use][Setuptools]]. Built and managed with [[https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html][conda]].

Project structure in line with official Python recommendations found [[https://packaging.python.org/overview/#][here]] and
[[https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/#setup-py][here]].

Test info coming soon.
